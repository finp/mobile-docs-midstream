= Using the {unifiedpush-service} Mobile Service
:page-partial:

[[introduction]]
The {unifiedpush-service} service allows you to send native push notifications to different mobile operating systems.

* Code once and push notifications to iOS and Android.
* Push notifications to defined groups.
* Push notifications to either iOS only or Android only.
* Push notifications to different variants of a mobile app.
* Push notifications from different back-end apps to the same mobile app.


Currently the service supports:

* link:https://developer.apple.com/notifications/[Apple Push Notification Service^]
* link:https://firebase.google.com/products/cloud-messaging/[Firebase Cloud Messaging^]


The {unifiedpush-service} service offers a unified Notification Service API to the above mentioned Push Network Services.
It can be seen as a _broker_ that distributes push messages to different 3rd party Push Networks.

[NOTE]
====
* The payload of the push notification is delivered to 3rd party Push Network providers, Google or Apple. {org-name} recommends that users do not send any sensitive personal or confidential information (for example, a social security number, financial account or transactional information) as part of any Push Notification. Users of push notifications should not have an expectation of secure transmission.

* For analytic purposes, the service stores the content of the +alert+ key sent to the UnifiedPush Server.
The content of the +alert+ key belongs to the metadata, which is deleted after 30 days, using a nightly job within the UnifiedPush Server.

* You are only able to send push notifications to a real device, sending push notifications to an emulator fails.

* Push is a signalling mechanism and is not suitable to be used as a data carrying system, for example, a chat application.
====

.Prerequisites

* You understand {unifiedpush-service}.
* You have logged into the OpenShift console and the Mobile Developer Console.

.Additional resources

* link:https://developer.apple.com/notifications/[Apple Push Notification Service^]
* link:https://firebase.google.com/products/cloud-messaging/[Firebase Cloud Messaging^]

[id='push-terminology-{context}']
= {unifiedpush-service} Terminology

This section describes terminology that is associated with {unifiedpush-service}.

Push Application:: A logical construct that represents an Mobile App, for example, _Mobile HR_.

Push Notification Message:: A simple message to be sent to a Push Application.

Sender Endpoint API:: A RESTful API that receives Push Notification Message requests for a PushApplication or some of its different Variants. The Server translates this request into the platform specific details and delivers the payload to the 3rd party cloud providers, which eventually might deliver the message to the physical device.

Variant:: A variant of the Push Application, representing a specific mobile platform, like iOS or Android, or even more fine-grained differentiation like iPad or iPhone.
There can be multiple variants for a single Push Application (for example, _Mobile HR Android_, _Mobile HR iPad_, _Mobile HR iOS free_ or _Mobile HR iOS premium).
Each supported variant type contains some platform specific properties, such as a Google API key (Android) or passphrase and certificate (Apple).

APNs:: link:https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/APNSOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH8-SW1[Apple Push Notification service].

Installation:: Represents an actual device, registered with the UnifiedPush Server. User1 running _HR Android_ app, while User2 runs _HR iPhone premium_ on his phone.

Administrative User Interface:: (AUI) The {push-ui} Web UI that allows you manage Push Applications and Variants, view statistics and send Push Notifications to devices.

[id='obtaining_firebase_cloud_messaging_credentials-{context}']
= Obtaining Firebase Cloud Messaging Credentials

This procedure describes how to obtain Firebase Cloud Messaging Credentials.

.Prerequisites

Before the Android application is able to receive the notifications, you must set up access to Firebase Cloud Messaging.
The following credentials are necessary to set up Firebase Cloud Messaging for your app:

 ** **Server key**
 ** **Sender ID**
 ** `google-services.json` file containing the credentials required to connect your app to Firebase and Google services.

.Procedure

. From the _Project Settings_ screen, switch to the _Cloud Messaging_ tab, where you can find the **Server key** and **Sender ID** (known in GCM as **Project Number**). There is also a _Legacy server key_ but it should not be used for new projects.

. Download the `google-services.json` file as described in the link:https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/7015592?hl=en[Google Documentation^].

[id='binding-an-app-to-{context}']
= Binding a {mobile-client} with the {unifiedpush-service} Service

To use mobile services, you must represent your mobile app in *Mobile Developer Console*, and that app must be associated with the mobile service.
This association is called *binding* and it is necessary for your mobile app to use that service.

.Prerequisites

* You have created a {mobile-client}.

Android::
+
--
* [x] Google account
* [x] Access to the Firebase console. Refer to link:https://firebase.google.com/docs/[Firebase Docs].
--
iOS::
+
--
* [x] Apple Developer account
* [x] APNs client TLS certificate. Refer to link:https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/dev82a71386a[official Apple guide].
--
====

.Procedure

To bind a {mobile-client} with a mobile service:

. Log in to the {mobile-developer-console}.

. Click on the {mobile-client} on the Overview screen.

. Navigate to *Mobile Services* tab.
+
image::mobile-clients-services-all-unbound.png[]

+
NOTE: It is possible to bind a {mobile-client} with a mobile service in the OpenShift console, however such bindings are not valid for the purposes of this procedure.

. Press *Bind to App* in the {service-name}.
. Fill out the binding parameters required by the {service-name} Service.
+
When you bind a mobile client to the {unifiedpush-service} service, a variant is created to store the credentials required to communicate with a push network.
Those credentials need to be provided in the binding dialog.
+
Choose a *Mobile Client Type* and fill out the required fields:
+
[tabs]
====
Android::
+
--
- Select `Android` from in the `Mobile Client Type` list.
- Enter a *Server Key* and a *Sender ID*. Both are present in the Firebase console.

--
- Select `iOS` from the `Mobile Client Type` list.
- Obtain an APNs client TLS certificate. Refer to link:https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/dev82a71386a[official Apple guide].
- Encode the certificate using base64 and paste the encoded certificate into the field labeled `iOS .p12 file`.
+
If you are using macOS:
+
----
cat <path/to/your/.p12> | base64
----
+
If you are using Linux and a version of `base64` that wraps lines, disable line wrapping as follows:

[id='registering-device']
= Registering device on {unifiedpush-service} Service

To receive native push notifications from a Push Network, for example APNs or FCM, the mobile device is identified with a unique device-token assigned by that Push Network.
This device-token is passed, by the operating system, to the mobile application.
Refer to the operating system and Push Network documentation for further details.

Every time a user launches a mobile app,  that app receives the  `device-token`, from a _platform-specific_ method (or callback).
Since the Push Network  may assign a new token to a device, {org-name} recommends that the app registers the `device-token` with the UnifiedPush Server each time.

The required metadata for an `Installation`:

* *deviceToken:* _Identifies the device/user-agent within its Push Network.
* *variantID:* The ID of the variant, where the client belongs to
* *variantSecret:* Password of the actual variant

The AeroGear UnifiedPush Server is able to store some user-specific metadata as well:

* *deviceType:* The device type of the device or the user agent.
* *operatingSystem:* The name of the underlying Operating System.
* *osVersion:* The version of the used Operating System.
* *alias:* Application specific alias to identify users with the system. For instance an `email address` or a `username`.
* *categories:* Used to apply one or more "tags".

The device-token needs to be registered with the AeroGear UnifiedPush Server, to indicate there is a new Installation for a Variant. This registration is performed by calling an endpoint of the server.
