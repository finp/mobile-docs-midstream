[id='binding-an-app-to-{context}']
= Binding a {mobile-client} with the {app-security-service} Service

To use mobile services, you must represent your mobile app in *Mobile Developer Console*, and that app must be associated with the mobile service.
This association is called *binding* and it is necessary for your mobile app to use that service.

This section describes how to set up the {app-security-service} service.

.Prerequisites

* You have created a {mobile-client}.

.Procedure

To bind a {mobile-client} with a mobile service:

. Launch {mobile-developer-console}.

. Click on the {mobile-client} on the Overview screen.

. Navigate to *Mobile Services* tab.
+
image::mobile-clients-services-all-unbound-down.png[]

+
NOTE: It is possible to bind a {mobile-client} with a mobile service in the OpenShift console, however such bindings are not valid for the purposes of this procedure.

. Click *Bind to App* for {app-security-service}.

. Fill out the binding parameters required by the {app-security-service} Service.


The {app-security-service} service will now be expandable, details about the service can be viewed.

== Downloading the Mobile Services Configuration File

. Open your {mobile-client} in Mobile Developer Console.
. Copy the `mobile-services.json` configuration to your clipboard.
. Save the contents of the clipboard to a new file called `mobile-services.json`.
+
NOTE: The mobile-services.json file is the link between your provisioned services on OpenShift and the mobile app you are developing. This file provides all required configuration to initialise the various SDKs and get them hooked up/connected to the back-end services.
. Follow the platform-specific instructions:

= Implementing the {app-security-service} service in your mobile app

Call the appSecurity clientInit function to implement the App Security Service.
Call this service on application initialization, for example:

[source,javascript]
----
appSecurity.clientInit()
.then(clientInit => {
  /**
    You can use clientInit.data.disabled boolean
    to check if app has been disabled by admin.

    The disabled message is returned if the app is
    disabled at clientInit.data.disabledMessage
    This contains a string with a disabled message
    from the server set by the admin.
  */
}).catch(err  => {
  /**
    You can handle errors connecting to the
    mobile security service here. i.e. if the
    client is offline that error will be caught
    here and you can return a response at this
    point
    */
});

[[console]]
:leveloffset: +2

= Managing mobile apps using the Mobile Security Console

To access the {app-security-service} Console:

. Retrieve the console URL from the list of available services in the Mobile Developer Console (MDC).
. Open the URL in a browser.


.Overview of the Mobile Security Console

The {app-security-service} Console allows you to monitor mobile apps, deployed versions, and disable versions of those mobile apps.

Opening the console lists all applications. Click on an application to view deployed versions of that mobile app.

A deployed version is registered with the Mobile Security service when a version of the app is released, for example, 1.2.3, and that version of the app is run on a device at least once.

Below is a detailed description of each of these views and the information you can expect each to contain.

.Application details view

This view provides statistics and information about each deployed version of an application:


* *App Version*: The version of the application.
* *Current Installs*: Total number of current installed versions of this version of the application.
* *Launches*: Total number of launches of this version of the application.
* *Last launched*: The last time this application version was launched.
* *Disable on Startup*: Whether this application version is disabled on startup.
* *Custom Disable Message*: A custom message that is displayed when this version of the mobile app is disabled.

== Enabling and disabling mobile app versions

To enable/disable one or more versions of the application:

. Toggle the checkbox for that version in the *Disable on Startup* column.
. Confirm these changes by clicking the *Save* button to persist these changes.

Navigating away from this screen with unsaved changes prompts you to save or discard these changes.

To disable all versions of an application:

* Click the *Disable App* button.

== Adding or updating a custom disabled message

To add or update a custom message for the version(s) of an application:

. Enter the message in the text field for that version under the *Custom Disable Message* column.
. Confirm these changes by clicking the *Save* button to persist these changes.

Navigating away from this screen with unsaved changes prompts you to save or discard these changes.

[id='device-checks']
= Implementing {device-security-service} in your mobile app
:page-partial:

The Device Security service allows you to easily configure and manage device security, and trust checks for your mobile application.

* Perform a range of device trust checks on the mobile device, such as checking if the device is rooted, and allows you take proactive action based on the results.
* Distribute SSL certificates with a Mobile App to create a direct chain of trust (certificate pinning).

NOTE: Device Security is not currently associated with an OpenShift service, so there are no provisioning or binding tasks associated with using Device Security.

.Prerequisites

* You understand {device-security-service}.
* You have logged into the OpenShift console and the Mobile Developer Console.
* You are developing an Ionic app, plain Cordova is not supported.

[id='security-terminology-{context}']
= {device-security-service} Terminology

This section describes terminology that is associated with {device-security-service}.


Root Access Detection (ROOT_ENABLED)::
Use it to help prevent your app running in a device that has been rooted/jailbroken. A device is considered rooted if *any* of the following are true:

- A custom key has been used to sign the kernel
- The `su` binaries are present


Developer Mode Detection (DEVELOPER_MODE_ENABLED)::
To detect if Developer Mode has been enabled on the device the `DeviceCheckType#DEVELOPER_MODE_ENABLED` function can be used. This function uses Android’s link:https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.html[Settings^] class.

Debugger Detection (DEBUGGER_ENABLED)::
To detect if an Android debugger is attached to the app the `DeviceCheckType#DEBUGGER_ENABLED` function can be used. This function uses Android’s link:https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Debug.html[Debug^] class.

Emulator Detection (IS_EMULATOR)::
To detect if the app is being run on an emulator the `DeviceCheckType#IS_EMULATOR` function can be used. This function uses Android’s link:https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.html[Build^] class.

Device Lock Detection (SCREEN_LOCK_ENABLED)::
To detect if a device has a lock screen set (with pin, fingerprint, pattern) the `DeviceCheckType#SCREEN_LOCK_ENABLED` function can be used. This function uses Android’s link:https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/KeyguardManager.html[KeyguardManager^] class.

App Data Backup Detection (BACKUP_ENABLED)::
To detect whether the application’s data is configured to be synchronized across devices the `DeviceCheckType#BACKUP_ENABLED` function can be used. The link:https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html[allowBackup^] flag determines whether to allow the application to participate in the backup and restore infrastructure, which might be interesting to avoid depending on your app’s needs.

Device Encryption Detection (ENCRYPTION_ENABLED)::
To detect whether the devices' filesystem is encrypted the `DeviceCheckType#ENCRYPTION_ENABLED` function can be used. This function uses Android’s link:https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager.html[DevicePolicyManager^] class.

== Invoking Multiple Device Checks

Device Checks can be run in group, both synchronously and asynchronously.

[discrete]
=== Synchronously

[tabs]
====
Cordova::
+
--
Executing multiple checks synchronously is not directly supported. Instead, it's possible to use the link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await[await^] operator.
[source, javascript]
----
const results = await securityService.checkMany(
    DeviceCheckType.rootEnabled,
    DeviceCheckType.isEmulator,
    // Add more checks here
);
----
NOTE: `DeviceCheckResult` objects in the returning array stay in the same order they were provided.
--
====

[discrete]
=== Asynchronously

[tabs]
====
Cordova::
+
--
Invoke multiple checks using the `checkMany` method:
[source, javascript]
----
const checkResults = securityService.checkMany(
    DeviceCheckType.rootEnabled,
    DevoceCheckType.isEmulator,
    // Add more checks here
)
.then(results => {
    // Handle results
});
----
NOTE: This method returns a Promise with an array containing all `DeviceCheckResult` objects in the same order they were provided.
--
====


== Additional Resources

[discrete]
=== Adding Custom Device Checks

It is possible to make use of your own custom checks. Follow the next steps depending on your platform to implement them:

[tabs]
====
Cordova::
+
--
. Implement the `DeviceCheck` interface:
+
[source, javascript]
----
class CustomDeviceCheck implements DeviceCheck {

    get name(): string {
        return "My Custom Check";
    }

    public check(): Promise<DeviceCheckResult> {
        // Implement device check logic here
        return null;
    }

}
----

. Instantiate it to execute it, using the instance of `SecurityService`:
+
[source, javascript]
----
const securityService = new SecurityService(app.metrics);

securityService.check(new CustomDeviceCheck())
    .then(result => {
        // Handle result
    });
----
--
====

[discrete]
=== Reporting Device Checks Results Via the Metrics Service

In order to report the results of Device Checks utilize this service in conjunction with the Mobile Metrics service.

[tabs]
====
Cordova::
+
--
Report individual checks via the `checkAndPublishMetric` method:

[source, javascript]
----
new SecurityService(app.metrics)
    .checkAndPublishMetric(DeviceCheckType.rootEnabled)
    .then(result => {
        // Handle the security result metric
        // result: { id: string, name: string, passed: boolean }
    });
----

Or alternatively report multiple checks using the `checkManyAndPublishMetric` method:

[source, javascript]
----
new SecurityService(app.metrics)
    .checkManyAndPublishMetric(
        DeviceCheckType.rootEnabled,
        DeviceCheckType.isEmulator,
        // Add more checks here
    )
    .then(results => {
        // Handle the security results array
    });

[id='certificate-pinning_{context}']
= Certificate Pinning in Android Devices

link:https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Certificate_and_Public_Key_Pinning[Certificate pinning^] can be enabled in individual SDKs through the `mobile-services.json` file.
Certificate pinning will only be enabled for services which are used directly by the SDKs. For
other services *SPKI* pinning is used. Mobile services must have pinning configured
separately. For more information on setting up certificate pinning for mobile services see the
link:https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-config.html#CertificatePinning[Android network security guide^].

== Generating Pinning Configuration

The {sdk} gets its configuration from the `https` section of the `mobile-services.json` file
in a project.

[source,json]
----
{
    "services":[],
    "https": {
        "certificatePins": [{
            "host": "example.sync.service",
            "certificateHash": "exampleHash"
        }]
    }
}
----

To include the `https` section in configuration when generating it using the Mobile CLI use the
`--include-cert-pins` flag when retrieving a client configuration. By default, self-signed or
invalid certs will not be permitted to be included in the certificate pinning configuration. To
allow these to be included use the `--insecure-skip-tls-verify` flag.

[source, bash]
----
$ ./mobile get clientconfig <client name> --include-cert-pins --insecure-skip-tls-verify
----

[discrete]
=== Using Pinning Configuration

If the `https` section is included in the `mobile-services.json` file then certificate pinning will
automatically be enabled for mobile services.

[discrete]
=== Considerations

If the certificate authority of a service changes then the `mobile-services.json` file will need to
be regenerated in order to retrieve the correct `https` configuration. The app will then need to be
rebuilt and republished for the end users to consume. If this is not done then an app may become
incapable of making network requests to other services.
